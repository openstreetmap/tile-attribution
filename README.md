OpenStreetMap Tile Attribution Issue Tracker
======================================

This repository is used for reporting and tracking sites which are using tile.openstreetmap.org servers but not attributing OpenStreetMap. The sites are tracked in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openstreetmap/tile-attribution/issues). Aaccepted issues automatically block websites.

Please [create a new issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/tile-attribution/issues/new/choose) to report problematic cases. Note that some steps needs to be first taken first and these steps are listed in the issue template.

Help with educating people about attribution requirements is welcome and helpful and reporting cases where it has not resulted in improvements is also encouraged.

[Lacking proper attribution](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Lacking_proper_attribution) on the OSM Wiki is a closely related listing, covering all kinds of cases of attribution issues, while this repository covers only cases where entities are using the OSMF standard layer and the OSM community already attempted contact and was ignored.
